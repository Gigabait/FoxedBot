# Introduction
**What is FoxedBot?!**  
FoxedBot is a SteamBot using [seishun][1]'s [node-steam][2] designed to control and administrate Garry's Mod servers using the Steam chat. It can also autonomously send messages to administrators when certain events occurs on a server, for example, when a player is calling for an administrator.

# Usage
Starting-up FoxedBot
--------------------
The first thing you probably want do at this point is to startup FoxedBot, to do so open a command prompt, navigate to the installation directory of FoxedBot and enter this command:
```
node app.js
```
Thats it, FoxedBot is now running, forever, or not.  
  
**Tip:**
As FoxedBot is pretty new and was coded by a French cunt (that's me) it is likely to have bugs and may crash, it is recommended that you run FoxedBot using [forever][7], a tool that will automatically restart FoxedBot if it crashes.

Adding and removing users
-------------------------
Before you brainlessly use the **adduser** command you need to be aware of this: as your bot is an "empty" Steam account it most likely won't be able to send friend requests. To add someone the person needs to send a friend request to the bot before you use the command adduser:
```
adduser <SteamID64>
deluser <SteamID64>
```
  
**Note:** If a server is having troubles connecting to the SteamBot run **foxedbot_reload** in the server console to attempt to fix it.

# Developers
_This section is for developers who which to add commands, callbacks and events._  
  
Commands, callbacks and event, what are they? Commands are functions that will be called when a command is ran, callbacks are functions that will be ran on the server when the SteamBot tells him to and events are functions that will be ran on the SteamBot when a server tells him to.
Commands
--------
Commands can easily be added to FoxedBot in the **config/commands.js** file.  
**Format**
```js
app.addCommand("CommandName", AdminOnly, function (steamID, name, args, strArgs) {});
```
**Arguments**

Type     | Description
---------|----------------------------------------------------------
string   | The name of the command
bool     | Whether or not the command is admin only
function | The function that will be called when the command is ran

**Function Arguments**

Variable   | Type     | Description
-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------
steamID    | string   | The SteamID64 of the user who ran the command
name       | string   | The name of the user who ran the command
args       | array    | The arguments of the command parsed as an array
strArgs    | string   | The arguments of the function in a raw string

**Example**
```js
app.addCommand("chat", false, function (steamID, name, args, strArgs) {
	if (app.Selected[steamID] && app.Selected[steamID].length > 0) { // Checks if the user selected a server.
		if (strArgs != "" && strArgs != " ") { // Checks if the ran arguments isn't empty
			var data = { // Creates the array that will be sent
				name: name,
				message: strArgs
			}
			for (var i in selected[steamID]) { // Calls the OnChat callback on all selected servers
				var serverID = app.Selected[steamID][i];
				func.sendToServer(serverID, "OnChat", data);
			}
		}
	} else {
		app.sendMessage(steamID, "You need to select a server first!"); // Tells the user to select a server
	}
});
```

Callbacks
---------
Callbacks can easily be added to FoxedBot in the **sv_callbacks.lua** file.  
**Format**
```lua
FoxedBot.addCallback("CallbackName", function( data ) end)
```
_data_ is a table containing data that may be required for the callback, for example a message to display.  
**Example**
```lua
FoxedBot.addCallback("OnRCON", function( data )
	game.ConsoleCommand(data.command.."\n") -- Executes data.command
	FoxedBot.sendMessage(data.steamID, data.command.." has been executed on server "..FoxedBot.ServerID..".") -- Sends a confirmation to the user
end)
```

Events
------
Events can easily be added to FoxedBot in the **sv_events.lua** and **config/events.js** files.  
**Sending event**
```lua
local data = {
	text = "Hello World!"
}

FoxedBot.sendEvent("EventName", data)
```

**Receiving an event**
```js
events.on("EventName", function (serverID, data) {});
```

**Example**
```lua
hook.Add("PlayerSay", "FoxedBot_PlayerSay", function( ply, text ) -- Called when a player says something
	if FoxedBot.SendChat then -- Checks is SendChat is enabled
		local data = { -- Creates the table to send
			name = ply:Name(),
			text = text
		}

		FoxedBot.sendEvent("OnChat", data) -- Sends the event to the SteamBot
	end
end)
```
```js
events.on("OnChat", function (serverID, data) {
	for (var i in app.Listening) { // For all users in the listening array
		if (app.Listening[i]) { // Checks if the user is listening
			if (app.Selected[i] && app.Selected[i][serverID]) { // Checks if the user is listening to the current serverID
				app.sendMessage(i, "[" + serverID + "] " + data.name + ": " + data.text); // Sends the chat to the user
			}
		}
	}
});
```
